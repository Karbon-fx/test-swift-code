## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: #FAFCFF to provide a light backdrop for the application.
- Primary color: #0657D0 - A vibrant blue, slightly lighter and more saturated than the user's requested button color, to indicate action and interactivity, and also align with conventional branding for financial institutions.
- Accent color: #0657D0 - A complementary, vibrant green, for positive confirmations and CTAs. An analogous color was deliberately avoided, to create more contrast with the primary.
- Body and headline font: 'Geist' font family; versatile and readable for all content.
- Center-aligned content with card-style interface for forms and results, ensuring mobile responsiveness and visual clarity.
- Light card with subtle shadow background to differentiate form areas.
